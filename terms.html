            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Pokémon Finder! By using this website, you agree to follow these completely unofficial and not-at-all-legally-binding terms. This is a fun project, not an official Pokémon service.</p>

            <p>Our website helps you locate Pokémon across the web (not in real life — sorry!). Please do not attempt to physically find or battle any Pokémon based on what you see here.</p>

            <p>You don’t need any actual Pokéballs or badges to use this site. Just curiosity and a love for those little monsters.</p>

            <h2>2. Not Affiliated with Nintendo</h2>
            <p>This is a fan-made project. We are not affiliated, endorsed, or associated with Nintendo, Game Freak, or The Pokémon Company in any way. All Pokémon content is property of their respective owners.</p>

            <h2>3. Data Accuracy</h2>
            <p>We try our best to show accurate and up-to-date info about Pokémon, but errors may occur. If you notice something funky (like Pikachu being labeled as a water type), feel free to laugh and let us know.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, we don't have a Professor Oak helpdesk. All info is shown as-is, with no guarantee of catching success or Pokédex completion.</p>

            <h2>4. Usage Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Use this site for fun and educational purposes only. Don’t try to hack the system or catch other users — that's not very trainer-like behavior.</p>

            <h2>5. Cookies (Sadly, Not the Lava Type)</h2>
            <p>This website may use cookies to enhance your experience, but not the kind Snorlax dreams about. Just digital ones.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms whenever we feel like it — or when a legendary Pokémon tells us to. Check back occasionally to stay in the loop.</p>

            <h2>7. Contact</h2>
            <p>Questions? Suggestions? Psychic messages? You can reach out to the site creator through the appropriate channels, like email or maybe a Pidgeotto messenger.</p>

            <h2>8. Final Word</h2>
            <p>Thanks for visiting Pokémon Finder! Remember: it's not about catching them all — it’s about having fun along the way.</p>
